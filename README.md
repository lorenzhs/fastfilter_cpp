Fast Filter: Fast approximate membership filter implementations (C++)

This is a research library currently. It is not meant for production use.

Originally, this library was written for Xor filters. It has since been expanded to cover many different data structures. This fork extends it to consider various ribbon-based data structures, most notably [BuRR](https://github.com/lorenzhs/BuRR).



## Prerequisites

- A  C++17 compiler such as GNU G++ or LLVM Clang++
- Make, CMake, and Ninja

Expectations:

- Though it should be possible to run this benchmark on any operating system, we expect Linux and use its performance counters to measure performance.
- We expect an x64 processor with AVX2 support though most filters work on any processor, if you compile on a machine that does not support AVX2 instructions, the corresponding filters that depend on AVX2 will be disabled.

## Usage

Make sure to select the right GNU GCC compiler (e.g., via `export export CXX=g++-8`).
You may want to disable hyperthreading and adjust page sizes. Run the benchmark
on a quiet machine.


```
git clone https://github.com/lorenzhs/fastfilter_cpp.git
cd fastfilter_cpp
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd benchmarks
make
./ribbon-benchmark.sh
```

Your results will depend on the hardware, on the compiler and how the system is configured. A sample output is as follows:

```
$ ./bulk-insert-and-query.exe 1000000
Using seed 894891901
Using add_count = 1000000 = 1 million input items and actual_sample_size = 1000000 = 1 million queries

```

As part of the benchmark, we check the correctness of the implementation.

## Benchmarking

The shell script `benchmarks/ribbon-benchmark.sh` runs the benchmark for 1 million, 10 million, and 100 million keys.
The benchmark is run 50 times, 5 times, and once, respectively.
It stores the results in the files `ribbon-results-$(hostname)-{1,10,100}-raw.txt`.
To get a low error, it is best run on a Linux machine that is not otherwise in use.

There is also a parallel benchmark in `benchmarks/run-par.sh`. This is described [in the BuRR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01892) in more detail.

Quotient filter benchmarks are run separately from `benchmarks/qf-bench.sh` and `benchmarks/qf-par-bench.sh` because they require differing input sizes.

## Where is your code?

The filter implementations are in `src/<type>/`. Most implementations depend on `src/hashutil.h`. Examples:

* src/bloom/bloom.h
* src/xorfilter/xorfilter.h
